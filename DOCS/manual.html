            <b><font color="#FF0000">Adding an account</font></b><br>
				New members should point a browser to join.php and fill out all fields.
            They get html code for adding to their site. Once they did it, the
            script begins to count their impressions. The script will
            automatically send an email to both the new member and to admin.
            Then the admin should go to the admin area and approve or delete the
            member.
            <br><br><b><font color="#FF0000">Statistic</font></b><br>
				All members can see statistic of their accounts. If you don't want to allow your members
            access to some of the stats, just delete the line from the template.
            You as admin can see statistic of all members.<br><br>

            <b><font color="#FF0000">Templates</font></b><br>
				The template feature of Easy Banner makes the script extremely easy
            to use. These templates are very easy to edit in your normal HTML
            editor. All of the templates are prepared and ready to use, no
            changes are necessary. If you will edit these templates, we recommend
            to save the original templates from your zip file to a safe place so
            you can restore the original templates in any time.<br>Below is a
